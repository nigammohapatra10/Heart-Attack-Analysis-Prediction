# Heart-Attack-Analysis-Prediction
With the dataset provided for heart attack analysis, we have to analyse the possibilities of heart attack on the basis of various features provided to us, and then the prediction from the data analysis will tell us that whether an individual is prone to heart attack or not. 

The detailed analysis can proceed with the exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

The classification for predication can be done using various machine learning model algorithms, choose the best suited model for heart attack analysis.
